## Lab 4

**Note**: This project makes use of the `svelte-app` and `vue-app` directories in the top level of this repo.

### Objective

**Understand how to use Git to manage your code workflow**

- Be able to use commands like `git log`, `git status`, `git pull`, `git fetch`, and `git merge`.
- Understand the options you can pass to `git commit`, `git branch`, and `git stash`.
- Feel comfortable resolving a merge conflict
- Leave a code review with suggested changes on Github

**Continue to get comfortable working in Vue and Svelte**

### Questions to check your understanding

- Where does the API call get triggered in the Vue app? Where in the Svelte app?
- What's the difference between `git pull`, `git fetch`, and `git merge`?
- How do you make suggested changes directly in Github?
- How do you amend a commit?
- How do you undo a commit?

### Features to try implementing

- [easy] Leave a code review suggesting at least one bug fix on [PR #3](https://github.com/visualizedata/major-studio-2/pull/3).
- [medium] Check out branch `alec/bike-decision` locally. Merge in branch `alec/umbrella-decision` and resolve the merge conflicts, then complete the merge. Push the commit with the clean merge to a new branch.
- [hard] Check out branch `alec/temperature-viz` locally. Notice that there are two commits (hint: use `git log`), but the first one has a vague commit message. Edit the message for that commit without losing the changes from the second commit.
