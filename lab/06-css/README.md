## Lab 6

**Note**: This project makes use of the `svelte-app` and `vue-app` directories in the top level of this repo.

### Objective

**Understand how to use CSS to add responsiveness and interactivity**

- Use media queries for different screen sizes
- Change appearance of elements based on their behavior

### Questions to check your understanding

- What does `1fr` mean in CSS grid? (If you need a thorough tutorial, [this](https://cssgridgarden.com/) is a good one.)
- What is the difference between "justify" and "align" in CSS flex?
- What different properties of the page can we use to define a CSS media query?

### Features to try implementing

- [easy] Change a media query breakpoint so that the mobile styles are applied for any screen the size of an iPad or smaller.
- [medium] Use the `cursor` CSS property to style the handle of the range slider in the BarChart component.
- [hard] Add an event listener for the `resize` event on the window. Update the hard-coded SVG width so it is never larger than the window width.
