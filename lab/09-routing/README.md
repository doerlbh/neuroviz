## Lab 9

**Note**: This project makes use of the `svelte-app` and `vue-app` directories in the top level of this repo.

### Objective

**Add routes to navigate around your app**

- Learn how to install `vue-router` and `svelte-router`
- Understand the relationship between routes and components
- Think about how routes should apply to your thesis projects

### Tasks to try

- Add a new route and corresponding component. For the Vue app, try putting the BarChart in its own route. For the Svelte app, add a route for methodology.
- Give the nav links different styling than the default
- The Svelte app has no content at the default route (`/`). What do you think should go there?
